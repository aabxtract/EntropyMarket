# **App Name**: Entropy Market

## Core Features:

- Seed Minting: Allows users to generate and mint unique randomness NFTs (Entropy Seeds) with associated purity scores and visual signatures.
- Marketplace Listing: Enables users to list their Entropy Seeds for sale on a decentralized marketplace with filtering and sorting options.
- Seed Details: Displays detailed attributes of an Entropy Seed, including its entropy purity, noise pattern, and hash, along with options to buy, sell, or use the seed.
- Random Drop Generation: Upon burning a seed, this feature generates a random reward (loot, traits, rewards) based on the seed's entropy purity, creating a gamified experience.
- Entropy Purity Oracle: Generates verifiable entropy scores and assigns them to seeds using a randomness tool.
- Profile Display: Shows a user's owned seeds, random drops, transaction history, and a randomness score based on the sum of purities owned.
- Orb Visualization: Creates interactive orb animations representing the unique characteristics of each seed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) for a futuristic, energetic feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for a dark sci-fi aesthetic.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and add a neon glow.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for titles, 'Inter' sans-serif for body. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist, glowing icons to represent seed attributes and marketplace functions.
- Implement a minimal layout with glassmorphism cards to present information in a modern, translucent style.
- Employ noise-based and probabilistic loading animations to enhance the feeling of randomness and anticipation.
